I was able to implement the MLE and EM algorithms with good efficiency. With fairly short runtimes I was able to do multiple runs on the large corpus prior to submission. However I am not seeing the performance improvement that would be expected by using the large corpus. Although my initial performance values are not bad ~76%-81% accuracy they do not improve at all when using the larger corpus. This could either be due to an error in the in my implementation or due to the fact that the verbiage used in the larger corpus is significantly different than that of the test and training corpuses. Either way I am pleased with my results, they might not be the most accurate but they demonstrate a clear understanding of the concepts and I was able to implement them in an efficient manner.
