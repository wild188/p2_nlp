Essentially NN

Mr. CC

that CC

After NN

Mr. DT

, CC
who WP

Mr. NN

, CC
on DT

Lasker WP

`` CC

'' DT
The NN

`` CC

'' DT
of CC
the DT

was DT
then CC
largely CC
a CC
confirmation WP

already CC
known CC
to CC
many CC
in WP
the DT

Had NN
the DT

gone CC

the DT

Was NN
there WP
a DT

Did NN
Mr. CC
Freeman WP
have DT
notice CC

Finally NN
, CC
was WP
the DT
information CC
material CC
? CC
Yet NN
, DT
all NNP
these CC
issues WP
are DT
subsidiary CC
to WP
a DT
more CC
central WP
issue DT
: NNP
Who CC
is WP
and DT
who NNP
should CC
be CC
making WP
the DT
criminal CC
law CC
here CC
? CC
It NN
is NNP
not NNP
my CC
contention CC
that CC
either WP
Mr. DT
Chestman CC
or WP
Mr. DT
Freeman CC
was WP
an DT
innocent CC
victim WP
of DT
prosecutorial CC
overzealousness WP
. DT
Arguably NN
, CC
both WP
were DT
on CC
notice WP
that DT
their NNP
behavior CC
was WP
at DT

risky WP
. DT
But NN
even CC
if WP
they DT
behaved CC
recklessly WP
, DT
reasons CC
still CC
exist CC
to CC
fear CC
and CC
resist WP
this DT
steady CC
process WP
of DT
case-by-case CC
judicial CC
extension CC
of CC
the DT
law WP
of DT
insider CC
trading WP
. DT
Courts NN
and DT
legislatures CC
make CC
decisions CC
in CC
very CC
different CC
ways CC
and CC
are DT
each CC
susceptible CC
to CC
very CC
different CC
kinds CC
of CC
errors WP
. DT
After-the-fact NN
judicial CC
examination CC
of CC
an DT
actor CC
's CC
conduct WP
has DT
always CC
been WP
the DT
common CC
law CC
's CC
method WP
. DT
When NN
only NNP
civil CC
liability CC
is CC
involved CC
, CC
this DT
method CC
has WP
the DT
undeniable CC
strengths WP
of DT
factual CC
specificity WP
and DT
avoidance CC
of CC
overgeneralization WP
. DT
Still NN
, DT
case-by-case CC
retrospective CC
decision CC
making CC
of CC
this DT
sort CC
is CC
vulnerable CC
to WP
the DT
tunnel CC
vision CC
caused WP
by DT
a CC
fixation WP
on DT
ad CC
hoc CC
-LRB- WP
and DT
usually CC
sleazy CC
-RRB- CC
examples WP
. DT
When NN
a DT
court CC
decides CC
that CC
a DT
particular CC
actor WP
's DT
conduct CC
was CC
culpable WP
and DT
so CC
extends WP
the DT
definition CC
of CC
insider DT
trading NNP
to CC
reach WP
this DT
conduct CC
, CC
it DT
does CC
not CC
see WP
the DT
potentially CC
enormous CC
number WP
of DT
other NNP
cases CC
that CC
will WP
be DT
covered CC
by WP
the DT
expanded CC
rule WP
. DT
Thus NN
, CC
a DT
court CC
is CC
poorly CC
positioned CC
to CC
make CC
judgments CC
about WP
the DT
social CC
utility CC
of CC
the DT
expanded CC
rule WP
. DT
For NN
example WP
, DT
in CC
focusing WP
on DT
Mr. CC
Freeman WP

attempt CC
to CC
gain CC
nonpublic CC
information WP
about DT

collapse CC
, CC
one WP
does DT
not NNP
naturally CC
think CC
about WP
the DT
reverse CC
side CC
of CC
the DT
coin NNP
: NNP
What CC
if WP
the DT
rumor CC
had WP
been DT
false CC
? CC
Can NN
a DT
security CC
analyst CC
call WP
an DT
investment CC
banker CC
to CC
make CC
certain CC
that CC
a DT
seemingly CC
improbable CC
rumor CC
is CC
in CC
fact CC
false CC
? CC
In NN
the DT
past WP
, DT
not CC
only WP
would DT
reputable CC
professionals WP
have DT
rushed CC
to CC
check WP
out DT
such NNP
rumors CC
with WP
the DT
company WP
, DT
but NNP
companies CC
listed CC
on WP
the DT
major NNP

exchanges WP
were DT
encouraged CC
by WP
the DT
exchanges CC
to CC
respond CC
openly CC
to CC
such CC
inquiries WP
from DT
securities CC
analysts WP
. DT
Today NN
, CC
after WP
Mr. DT
Freeman CC
's CC
plea WP
, DT
there NNP
is CC
an CC
uncertainty WP
that DT
is CC
both CC
unfair CC
and CC
inefficient WP
. DT
In NN
this DT
light CC
, CC
the DT
comparative CC
advantages WP
of DT
legislative CC
law-making CC
become CC
clear WP
: DT
-LRB- NNP
1 CC
-RRB- CC
Before WP
it DT

, CC
the DT
legislature CC
typically CC
will CC
hear WP
the DT
views CC

representatives WP
of DT
all NNP
those CC
affected WP
by DT
its CC
decision WP
, DT
not CC
just WP
the DT
immediate CC
parties CC
before WP

-LRB- NNP
2 CC
-RRB- WP
the DT
legislature CC
can CC
frame WP
`` DT
bright CC
line WP
'' DT
standards CC
that CC
create DT
less NNP
uncertainty CC
than WP
the DT
fact-bound CC
decisions CC
of CC

. DT
Although NN
legislative DT
lines NNP
can NNP
result CC
in CC
under-inclusion CC
-LRB- WP
which DT
explains CC
why WP
the DT
SEC WP
has DT
long CC
resisted WP
a DT
legislative CC
definition CC
of CC
insider WP
trading DT
-RRB- NNP
, CC
judicial DT
lawmaking NNP
inevitably NNP
creates NNP
uncertainty NNP
because NNP

the DT
shadowy CC
outer CC
edges CC

implications WP
of DT
most NNP
judicial CC
decisions WP
. DT
At NN

when WP

results CC
in CC
overinclusion WP
, DT
as CC
individuals WP
do DT
not NNP

to CC
approach WP

uncertain CC
line CC
closely WP
. DT
The NN
federal CC
mail WP

wire CC
fraud CC
statutes WP
provide DT
even NNP
better CC
illustrations CC
of CC
the DT
rapid CC
evolution CC
of CC

federal NNP
common CC
law WP
of DT
white-collar CC
crime WP
. DT
In NN
1987 NNP
, CC
the DT
Supreme CC

Yet NN
, DT

reversed WP
this DT

Opponents NN

Decisions NN

The NN

On NN
